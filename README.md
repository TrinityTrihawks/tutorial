# Java Basics for FIRST Robotics

A set of short, beginner-friendly Java exercises for high school robotics students. Each exercise is a separate Gradle subproject with its own README, starter code, and JUnit tests so one broken module will not block the rest.

## How to use
- Install JDK 17+ and Gradle (or use the included Gradle wrapper scripts once generated).
- From the repo root, run `./gradlew :module-name:test` to work on a single module.
- Each module README explains goals, starter files, and what to implement. Tests will fail until you complete the exercise.
- Timebox each module to 15–30 minutes.

## Modules
1. `1-setup-hello-world`
2. `2-variables-and-types`
3. `3-expressions-and-control-flow`
4. `4-loops-and-iteration`
5. `5-methods-and-parameters`
6. `6-arrays-and-lists`
